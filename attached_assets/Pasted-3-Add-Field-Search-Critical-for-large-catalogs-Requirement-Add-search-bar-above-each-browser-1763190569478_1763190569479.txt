3. Add Field Search

Critical for large catalogs.

Requirement:
	•	Add search bar above each browser pane.
	•	Search filters:
	•	Field name
	•	Object
	•	Description
	•	System (optional)
	•	Search should combine with system/object filters, not disable them.

4. Sticky Headers for All Major Sections

Problem: Headers disappear when scrolling, breaking navigation context.
Requirement:
Make the following fixed:
	•	App header
	•	Flows header / sidebar
	•	Source Fields header
	•	Mappings header
	•	Target Fields header

Use CSS position: sticky; top: Xpx; z-index: high.

5. Layout Adjustment — Mappings Should Be the Center Focus

Problem: Mappings panel is too narrow, browsers too wide.
Requirement:
	•	Reduce browser pane widths to ~25% each
	•	Increase mappings container to ~50%
	•	Increase flows sidebar width (10–15% → ~20%)
	•	Add responsive logic so center always dominates focus.

6. Need ability to Save Progress (Local or Cloud)

This is essential for a real ICD workflow.

Requirement:
Implement Save / Load:

Minimum viable:
	•	Save to browser localStorage:
	•	all flows
	•	all mappings
	•	field selections
	•	Load automatically on open
	•	Add explicit “Save” and “Reset Workspace” buttons

Ideal future:
	•	Import/Export .json workspace file
	•	Sync to backend or GitHub Gist, but MVP is local.

7. Drag & Drop Still Not Working

Huge blocker — DnD is fundamental to workflow.

Requirement:
Replace or properly implement DnD using:

Preferred:

dnd-kit (actively maintained)

Behavior:
	•	Drag source field → create mapping row
	•	Drag target field → complete mapping row
	•	Drag mapping rows → reorder
	•	Drop onto empty space → create new row

Notes:

Clicking to add should remain optional fallback, not primary method.

✨ Enhancements (Strongly Recommended)

8. Flow organization improvements
	•	Add icons for copy, rename, delete
	•	Collapsible flow sections in the mapping grid
	•	Flow-filters: “Show only this flow” / “Show all flows”

⸻

9. Pill visual hierarchy

To match feedback from Round 1 + new font:
	•	Field name: bold, slightly tighter line-height
	•	Meta: smaller, dimmer, horizontally aligned

No visual noise.

⸻

10. Add keyboard navigation
	•	Arrow keys move between pills
	•	Enter adds field
	•	Cmd/Ctrl + F focuses search bar

⸻

🎨 Cosmetic (Light but High-Impact)
	1.	Header typography should use Zalando Sans with wide tracking per theme spec.
	2.	Decrease rounding further (1–2px or full square).
	3.	Increase spacing in the mapping table (more breathable).
	4.	Field pill hover state should flatten and shift borders, not glow.
