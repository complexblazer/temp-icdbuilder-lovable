Technical / Bug Feedback

1. Single-Flow Limitation

Problem: Current export supports only one flow_id per mapping session.
Impact: I cannot author multiple flows in one session (all 18 flows need to be buildable in parallel).
Requirement:
	•	Allow multi-flow authoring.
	•	Each flow should be collapsible, with a dedicated panel.
	•	I should be able to toggle between flows with a sidebar or dropdown.
	•	Export should include all flows in one CSV.

2. Field Type Not Loaded from CSV

Problem: data_type is not populating even though present in "type" column of my fields_catalog.
Likely Cause: Normalize logic only checks data_type key; must check the exact column name "type" or "Type".
Requirement: Update parser to read:
row.data_type || row.type || row.Type || row.dataType.

3. Missing ICD Attributes / Columns

These are required for actual ICD population:
	•	required_by_system
	•	required_in_integration
	•	priority_level

Requirement:
Add these as editable columns in MappingTable with dropdown presets:
	•	Required: Yes/No
	•	Priority: P0 / P1 / P2

⸻

4. System/Object Filters Not Behaving Reliably

Symptoms:
	•	First two rows in the FieldBrowser reset when clicking.
	•	Clicking deeper rows reverts the list.
	•	Selected system/object filters sometimes ignored.

Requirement:
Stabilize filtering logic:
	•	Filters must narrow dataset deterministically.
	•	Clicking a field should NOT refresh the list unless system/object actually changed.
	•	Do not re-render source list based on current mappings.

5. Drag & Drop Not Working

Problem: UI only supports click-to-add; DnD is non-functional.
Impact: Critical blocker — I cannot add source/target in arbitrary order; the tool forces paired entry.

Requirements:
	•	Implement actual Drag & Drop using dnd-kit or react-beautiful-dnd.
	•	Allow dragging a source field into mapping table without requiring target.
	•	Allow dragging target field later into same row.
	•	Allow dragging to reorder mappings.

✨ Enhancement Requests

1. Ability to Author Net-New Fields

Use case: fields that aren’t yet in Centric, Fulfil, or Salsify.
Requirement:
	•	Button: “Add custom field”
	•	Modal captures: system, object, field, type, required, description.

⸻

2. Flag Fields as Required

Requirement:
	•	Add checkbox for required at the mapping row level.
	•	Should support both:
	•	Required by the source system
	•	Required by the integration logic (ICD requirement)

⸻

3. “Human Name / Common Name” Column

This is needed for readability + engineering.
Requirement: Add editable column human_name.

⸻

4. Manual Reordering of Fields

Requirement:
	•	Allow up/down arrows or drag-to-reorder on mapping rows.
	•	(Future): optional auto-sorting by:
	•	Domain model
	•	API call sequence
	•	Business priority

⸻

5. Color Coding

Improves at-a-glance scanning.
Requirement:
	•	Color code rows by system:
	•	Centric = muted orange
	•	Fulfil = green
	•	Salsify = purple
	•	Optionally color-coded by flow.

⸻

6. Field Inspector Modal

Requirement:
	•	Clicking any field (in browser or mapping table) opens a modal showing:
	•	System
	•	Object
	•	Field
	•	Description
	•	Type
	•	Required
	•	Key Type (PK/FK/Ref/Enum/BusinessKey)
	•	Allowed values (enum)
	•	Example
	•	Used in which flows (see #7)

⸻

7. “Used in Mappings” Indicator

Requirement:
	•	A badge in the browser next to fields currently used in active mapping.
	•	E.g., “In use (Flow 08, Flow 11)”

⸻

8. Multi-Flow Mode

After multi-flow storage is fixed, add:
	•	Left sidebar listing flows
	•	Toggle “View: Single Flow / All Flows”
	•	In “All Flows” mode, merges mapping rows grouped by flow header
