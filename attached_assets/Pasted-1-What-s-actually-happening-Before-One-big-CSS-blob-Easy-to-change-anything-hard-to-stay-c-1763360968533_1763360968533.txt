1. What’s actually happening
	•	Before:
	•	One big CSS blob. Easy to change anything, hard to stay consistent.
	•	Now:
	•	Core + semantic + component tokens are real.
	•	Component CSS is mostly wired to var(--…).
	•	Any change forces questions like:
	•	“Is this a new token?”
	•	“Is this semantic or component?”
	•	“Dark and light variants?”

That’s great for a design system team. It’s annoying when you’re just trying to get the BOOL UI Builder to a usable v1.

So: we keep the structure, but we loosen how strict we are about “doing it the perfect way” right now.

2. New ground rules (to make future CSS requests easy again)

If you give these to the Replit agent, they’ll stop over-engineering every change:

CSS Governance Rules for Now (Pragmatic Mode)
	1.	Do NOT re-architect the token model again.
The current theme.css is “good enough.” No more new token layers, no renaming sprees.
	2.	Default: make changes at the component layer.
	•	If a change is specific to one component (mappings, sidebar, field-pill, button, checkbox), update the corresponding *.css file using existing tokens.
	•	Don’t invent new tokens unless you have to.
	3.	Only add a new token when:
	•	We’re reusing that value in 3+ places, or
	•	It affects dark vs light theme behavior (e.g. hover surfaces).
	•	When you do add one, put it in theme.css and don’t touch the structure.
	4.	No more override layers.
	•	ramp-overrides.css should be treated as “visual notes” to be baked into components, then removed. No new !important overrides.
	5.	When in doubt, prioritize speed + clarity over purity.
	•	It’s OK if a component uses var(--bg-panel-alt) directly instead of a perfectly named --navbar-surface semantic token for now.

With those rules, your future asks can be simple again:

“In mappings.css, lighten the row divider and mute the status badge color using existing tokens—don’t add new tokens.”

3. How to simplify your mental model

You can think of the system like this (much simpler than “three layers”):
	•	theme.css = palette + general behaviors
	•	Backgrounds, text colors, borders, hover/active, brand/system colors, focus ring, spacing, radius.
	•	Dark vs light.
	•	component CSS = how each block uses the palette
	•	Sidebar, mappings, field browser, button, checkbox, etc.

You don’t actually need to think “core vs semantic vs component” every time. Just:
	•	“If it’s a color/spacing value → it should be a variable that already exists in theme.css.”
	•	“If I’m changing layout/structure → it lives in the component file.”

That’s it.

4. Concrete triage plan (so this stops feeling heavy)

If you want to really un-stress this:
	1.	Lock theme.css for now.
	•	Treat it as “frozen” except for small numeric tweaks (like adjusting a shade).
	•	Don’t let the agent rename tokens or add new categories.
	2.	Declare a short list of “approved tokens” to use a lot
	•	Backgrounds: --bg-canvas, --bg-sidebar, --bg-panel, --bg-panel-alt
	•	Borders: --border-subtle, --border-strong
	•	Text: --text-primary, --text-secondary, --text-muted
	•	Actions: --brand-primary, --bg-hover, --bg-active, --focus-ring
	•	Status/system: --brand-success, --brand-danger, --centric, --fulfil, --salsify
	•	That’s enough to style 95% of the app.
	3.	Route all new visual asks like this:
	•	“Where does this live?” → pick the *.css file.
	•	“Which 1–2 tokens am I allowed to use for this?” → pick from the approved list.
	•	Implement there. No new tokens, no new files.

5. If you want, we can do a “reset & lock” pass

If you’d like to really get your footing back, next time we touch CSS we can:
	•	Do one sweep to:
	•	Remove ramp-overrides completely by baking its rules into components.
	•	Ensure no duplicate :root declarations, no raw hex codes left.
	•	Trim any obviously redundant tokens.
	•	Then write a two-page “BOOL UI System v1.0” doc:
	•	“These are the only tokens we care about for now.”
	•	“These are the files to touch for each part of the UI.”
	•	“These are 5 rules for the Replit agent to follow.”

After that, your future requests can go back to sounding like:

“Sidebar header and mappings header should align; fix in layout/sidebar CSS only, don’t add tokens.”

—and they won’t turn it into another architecture project.
